# TODO: Add Export to Excel for All Pages

## Information Gathered
- **Dashboard**: Displays overview data (stock, sales, profit), top selling medicines, department overview. No export currently.
- **Medicine Management**: Has `handleExport` function using XLSX, exports filtered medicines. May not be functional.
- **POS System**: Displays medicines for sale, cart. No export currently.
- **Reports/Analytics**: Has `handleExport` function, exports multiple sheets (summary, sales trend, etc.). May not be functional.
- **Sold Medicines**: Displays sales details with filters. No export currently.
- XLSX library is installed (`xlsx: "^0.18.5"`).

## Plan
1. **Fix existing exports** in Medicine Management and Analytics if broken.
2. **Add export to Dashboard**: Export overview summary, top selling medicines, department overview in separate sheets.
3. **Add export to POS System**: Export the current medicines list (inventory for sale).
4. **Add export to Sold Medicines**: Export the filtered sales data with items details.
5. **Test all exports** to ensure they work and are well-formatted with column names and rows.

## Dependent Files to be Edited
- `src/components/dashboard.tsx`: Add export button and handleExport function.
- `src/components/medicine-management.tsx`: Fix handleExport if needed.
- `src/components/pos-system.tsx`: Add export button and handleExport function.
- `src/components/analytics-dashboard.tsx`: Fix handleExport if needed.
- `src/pos/sold-medicines.tsx`: Add export button and handleExport function.

## Followup Steps
- Install dependencies if needed (XLSX is already installed).
- Test each export by running the app and clicking export buttons.
- Ensure exported Excel files have proper column headers and formatted data.
